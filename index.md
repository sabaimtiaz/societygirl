## Podcast: Notes on a Scandal 

The limited-series podcast explores he mysterious death of Mustafa Zaidi, a famous poet and former high-ranking government officer in Pakistan, who was found dead in his house in Karachi while a woman lay unconscious nearby. It caused such a scandal in Pakistan in 1970 that the Associated Press dubbed it ‘Pakistan’s first jet set murder.' Over 50 years later, the case is still unresolved, and rife with conspiracies and conjecture. [More here](podcast.md).
