## Reviews

"The book is a riveting archival investigation written with a fine sense of drama and an eye for detail. This story of a society scandal and a deep tragedy for those directly impacted, is also in many ways a fascinating snapshot of the social history of upper-class Karachi and Pakistan in a transformative year of its history. A gripping read and highly recommended." - [Open Magazine](https://openthemagazine.com/lounge/books/fault-lines-in-karachi/)

"Society Girl is not just an enthralling retelling of a cold case but a fascinating study of media sensationalism.” - [Dawn Images](https://images.dawn.com/news/1192993/book-review-society-girl-a-tale-of-sex-lies-and-scandal-revisits-one-of-pakistans-most-intriguing-cold-cases)

"Skilfully swimming through the narrowness of Lahore’s bloodlines to finding liberation in Karachi’s cosmopolitanism and glittering nightlife, this is a jigsaw galaxy made up of thousands of scattered pieces from different planets. Truly, Imtiaz and Masood-Khan have set the bar with their stellar investigative skills and proven to be master storytellers." - [The Friday Times](https://thefridaytimes.com/23-Nov-2024/a-homemaker-and-a-poet-fall-in-love-what-could-possibly-go-wrong)

"Creative non-fiction is a convenient way to circumvent the issue of what color coat a person wore, or whether it was raining on a particular day, but non-fiction is exacting. This is especially true for a story such as the Zaidi-Gul case, where veering into judgment would defeat the purpose of the narrative, which the authors say is an effort to provide some clarity around the gossip and salacious rumor-mongering that still marks the case." - [Dunya Digital](https://dunyadigital.co/feature_40.html)

## About the Book

<img src="assets/images/societygirl-cover.jpg" alt="Cover" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 300px;" />

On an October morning in 1970, phones began ringing all over Karachi. The charismatic young poet and former civil servant Mustafa Zaidi had been found dead in his bedroom. He wasn’t alone: Shahnaz Gul, a stunningly beautiful, married socialite, with whom Zaidi had been having an affair, was lying unconscious in the next room, seemingly drugged. 

The ensuing scandal would shake Pakistani society, becoming a fixture on the front pages of newspapers even as the country went from one cataclysmic event to another. It grew to include obsession, revenge porn, the involvement of influential politicians and businessmen, and even a smuggling ring. 

But two autopsies, several investigations, and one trial later – no one was able to answer what exactly happened in that bedroom, and how Mustafa Zaidi ended up dead. 

Over fifty years later, [authors Saba Imtiaz and Tooba Masood-Khan](/about_authors.html) attempt to answer this question in Society Girl. Their retelling of, and years-long investigation into this story of twisted motives and murderous intentions, of it-girls and playboys, of class and culture, and a press out for blood and salaciousness, led to a far more complex tale than anyone could have possibly imagined.


## Praise for Society Girl
‘A captivating true crime drama that will have you gripped till the very last page.’ — **Sonia Faleiro**, author of *The Good Girls: An Ordinary Killing*

‘They take a sensational story and turn it into our social history... a leisurely exploration of early ’70s Pakistan, social mobility, a woman trying to have a family and a life, occasionally a collage of the social mores and a series of what-the-hell-just-happened moments.’ --**Mohammed Hanif**, author of *A Case of Exploding Mangoes* and *Our Lady of Alice Bhatti*

‘Vivid, gripping and meticulously crafted, this is a wonderfully fascinating journey into ’70s Karachi high society, a mysterious death shining a light on the whirl of social and political undercurrents of the time.’ — **Mahesh Rao**, author of *Polite Society*
